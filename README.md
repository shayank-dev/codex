# Pigeon Marketplace

This is a simple Flask web app for buying and selling pigeons. Listings are stored in-memory, so data will reset each time the server restarts.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see the marketplace.
